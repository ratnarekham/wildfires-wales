            <h3>Small Country, Big Problem</h3>
            In 2025, Wales experienced the highest wildfire impact compared to the rest of the UK. 
            Despite being much smaller than Scotland and England, Wales has the second-highest absolute burned area this year. It also bears the brunt relative to its size, with the highest burned area per hectare.<br>

                Wildfires are written into the law of nature. Acting as natural regulators of ecosystems, they even helped with evolution of pine trees to become as we know it today. However, recent wildfires have become unrecognizable from the ones in the past. They are now larger, more furious, and increasingly difficult to control. What changed?
